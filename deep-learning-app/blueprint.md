# Blueprint: Next Steps for Deep Learning Framework

## Completed
- Polymorphic neuron types (Linear, Quadratic, SIREN, RBF, Rational, Complex)
- Heterogeneous layers (mixing neuron types)
- Hybrid activation system (per-layer and per-neuron)
- Backend abstraction (CPU/CUDA, extensible)
- Robust forward and backward passes for all neuron and layer types
- Per-layer input cache (no global state)
- Multi-layer (deep) network support
- Comprehensive tests for forward, backward, and parameter update logic
- All tests pass (single-layer, multi-layer, batch, and single-sample)
- Future-proof, modular design

## Next Steps

1. **Loss Functions**
   - Implement standard loss functions (e.g., MSE, CrossEntropy) with forward and backward methods.
2. **Training Loop**
   - Build a training loop: forward pass, loss computation, backward pass, parameter update.
3. **Model Abstraction**
   - Create a `Model` class to manage layers and orchestrate training.
4. **Testing Training**
   - Add tests to verify loss decreases and parameters converge on simple tasks.
5. **Optimizers (Optional)**
   - Implement advanced optimizers (Adam, RMSProp, etc.).

This plan will bring the framework to full training capability and make it easy to extend for research and production use.
