## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++11 or later
- CMake

### Building the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd deep-learning-app
   ```

2. Create a build directory and navigate into it:
   ```
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```

3. Run CMake to configure the project:
   ```
   cmake ..
   ```

4. Build the project:
   ```
   make
   ```
